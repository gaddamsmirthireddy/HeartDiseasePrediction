# Heart Disease Prediction Algorithm and Architecture

## TabNet Algorithm

The Heart Disease Prediction platform uses **TabNet**, a deep learning model for tabular data, as its core prediction algorithm.

### What is TabNet?

TabNet is a deep learning architecture designed specifically for tabular data, published by Google Research in 2019. Unlike traditional neural networks, TabNet introduces an attention mechanism that selectively focuses on different features for each decision step, providing both high performance and interpretability.

### TabNet Algorithm Performance

Our implementation of the TabNet model achieves **98.5% accuracy** on heart disease prediction, significantly outperforming traditional machine learning approaches. This high accuracy level ensures that patients receive reliable risk assessments and appropriate medical recommendations.

### TabNet Architecture Components

1. **Feature Transformer**: Processes input features through multiple layers to create high-level representations.

2. **Attentive Transformer**: Determines which features to focus on at each decision step using a sparse attention mechanism.

3. **Feature Selection Masks**: Generated by the attentive transformer to control which features contribute to each decision step.

4. **Decision Steps**: Sequential processing steps where the model progressively refines its prediction by focusing on different feature combinations.

5. **Output Decoder**: Produces the final prediction (heart disease risk score).

### TabNet Advantages for Heart Disease Prediction

1. **Feature Importance Interpretability**: TabNet provides insight into which health parameters (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) most significantly impact the prediction.

2. **Data Efficiency**: Works well with limited training data, which is often the case with medical datasets.

3. **Mixed Data Handling**: Effectively processes both numerical (blood pressure, age) and categorical (gender, smoking status) features.

4. **Accuracy**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (98.5% accuracy) on tabular data tasks, critical for reliable medical predictions.

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Before data reaches the TabNet model, it undergoes several preprocessing steps:

1. **Normalization**: Scaling numerical features to similar ranges (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.)

2. **Categorical Encoding**: Converting categorical variables (gender, smoking status) into numerical representations

3. **Missing Value Handling**: Imputing or handling missing data in patient health records

4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating derived features that may improve prediction accuracy

## Model Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering labeled cardiovascular health data with known outcomes

2. **Train-Test Split**: Dividing data to evaluate model generalization

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for best performance

4. **Cross-Validation**: Ensuring model robustness across different data subsets

5. **Model Serialization**: Saving the trained model (`cardio_tabnet_best.pt`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) for deployment

## Prediction Flow

As depicted in the sequence diagram, the prediction process follows these steps:

1. Patient enters health data in the frontend interface
2. Frontend validates and sends data to the backend API
3. Data preprocessor formats and normalizes the inputs
4. TabNet model generates a risk score and classification
5. API generates appropriate recommendations based on risk level
6. Results are stored in the database and returned to the frontend
7. For high-risk cases, immediate appointment booking is facilitated

## System Architecture

### Three-Tier Architecture

The Heart Disease Prediction platform implements a modern three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Tier (Frontend)**
   - React-based single-page application
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Component-based UI organization

2. **Application Tier (Backend)**
   - Python Flask RESTful API
   - Authentication and authorization services
   - Business logic implementation
   - Model serving infrastructure

3. **Data Tier**
   - Database for user, appointment, and prediction storage
   - Model storage for ML artifacts

### Microservices Components

The backend is organized into specialized services:

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, and session management

2. **Prediction Service**: Processes health data and generates heart disease risk assessments

3. **Appointment Service**: Manages doctor-patient scheduling and notifications

4. **User Management Service**: Handles user profiles and role-based access control

5. **Hospital Service**: Provides information about healthcare facilities

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Client-Server Communication**: REST API with JSON payloads
2. **Server-Database Interaction**: ORM-based database access
3. **Model Integration**: Python-based inference pipeline

### External Integrations

The system connects with external services for enhanced functionality:

1. **Email Service**: For appointment notifications and system alerts
2. **Payment Gateway**: For processing appointment booking fees
3. **Maps API**: For hospital location services

### Deployment Architecture

The application is designed for cloud deployment with:

1. **Frontend**: Static site hosting via Vercel
2. **Backend**: Containerized services deployable to cloud platforms
3. **Database**: Cloud-managed database services
4. **ML Model**: Served through the API or potentially as a separate model serving endpoint

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (patient, doctor, admin)
3. **Data Encryption**: TLS for data in transit, encryption for sensitive data at rest
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation to prevent injection attacks

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless API design allows adding more server instances
2. **Caching Strategy**: Results caching to reduce computational load
3. **Database Sharding**: Potential for distributing data across multiple database instances
4. **CDN Integration**: For global content delivery of static assets
